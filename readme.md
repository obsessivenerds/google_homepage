This is the readme file for The Odin Project website creation lesson.

I staged this file to git and was able to stage it successfully.

I was able to add all of the elements fairly easily.  The searchbox was the most challenging.  I reviewed the google homepage code through the developer tools, and referred back to several examples that other students completed.  I used bits from several different examples for guidance to make it work with how my code was organized.
